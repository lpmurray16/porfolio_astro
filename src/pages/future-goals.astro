                        For 4 years at DePaul I studied and formed a solid
                        understanding of all things software and development.
                        Learning multiple languages and adding tools to my belt
                        allowed me to decide what kind of developer I wanted to
                        be.

                        COVID hit the last few weeks of class and a few of my
                        finals were taken online instead of at campus. My
                        commencement was now a YouTube video instead of your
                        traditional walk ceremony. But I finally finished and
                        received my BS in CS and was on to bigger and better
                        things.

                        After I was freed from the shackles of school I started
                        to explore other areas of my profession. I started
                        working with HTML and CSS and JS more in my experiments
                        and projects. It seemed like web development was a fun
                        and fast paced area of software development that I
                        enjoyed the most.

                        I continued to develope my skills in the area of web
                        development. Honing in my HTML/CSS/JS knowledge and
                        abilities. Eventually I found my foot in the door of a
                        digital marketing and website management company called
                        Officite. Here I am able to use my knowledge on actual
                        client websites and learn more about design patterns and
                        the culture of office life at a large business. It is
                        the perfect place for a FED who was just starting out.

                        React as a library or framework (however you want to
                        call it) is extremely popular. But for a good reason.
                        Along my journey to become a fullstack developer I know
                        how important it is to learn and understand a frontend
                        framework such as React or Vue. I plan on getting my
                        certificate in React by March.
